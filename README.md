## Idea
We need to create a smallish, modular vending machine that has n-amount of locked drawers and should be able to unlock a specific drawer for people to retreive a sticker from the stack in in

## Housing
Housing can be 3D-printed and should be modular.

## Locking mechanism
If we can attach a lid to each drawer in the back and mount a circular shaped plate to a servo motor with multiple notches we can use the server to unlock a specific drawer. This should work for 4 drawers with a servo placed in between them.

## Authentication
We can use an RDID chip which is unique to every person. It should be used to control the amount of stickers that can be retrieved (eg one per hour/day).
